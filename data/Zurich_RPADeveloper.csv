Zürich, Switzerland - Zürich

Your role

Are you solid as a rock when you’re juggling a lot of projects? Do you know how to talk to all kinds of different people?

What we are looking for

Technical and business acumen. You understand requirements beyond the written word. Whether you’re working on a research report or an API used by other developers, an internal tool consumed by our operation teams, or a feature used by millions of customers, your attention to details leads to a delightful user experience.
Fast learner. We’re looking for software engineers who thrive on learning new technologies and don’t believe in one-size-fits-all solutions. You should be able to adapt easily to meet the needs of our massive growth and rapidly evolving business environment. You have advanced knowledge of at least one programming language (e.g., Python or JavaScript) and knowledge of or eagerness to learn others for example PostgreSQL, React.
Fearlessness. You think a working proof-of-concept is the best way to make a point. You strive on proving that speed and quality are not conflicting; that you can achieve both at the same time.
Passion. You feel ownership over everything you ship; you'd never call code ""released"" until you’re confident it’s correct. You pride yourself on efficient monitoring, strong documentation, and proper test coverage.
